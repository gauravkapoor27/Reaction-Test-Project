# Reaction-Test-Project

A reaction test web app I built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Once the game has started, the user's task is to click on the screen once a green light appears. Has functionality to display previous scores as well as 
your average reaction time in a unique way. I also added functionality to end the game if the user clicks before the green light appears. This was challenging at first,
due to the necessary change of state. I'm very happy about how this app turned out, despite its simplicity!
